Tethering
=========

A tethering GUI for the `Jolla`_ phone (`SailfishOS`_). It supports Bluetooth and
Wifi (WPA2) tethering by controlling `ConnMan`_ directly via D-BUS. The GUI will
automatically create a packet data connection and power on the necessary
interface(s), when enabling tethering. It will also restore the states of
the interfaces, when a user disables tethering.

.. _`SailfishOS`: http://sailfishos.org
.. _`ConnMan`: http://connman.net

At the moment only basic information is shown in the GUI. This is somewhat
due to the fact that ConnMan doesn't (yet) provide detailed information about
tethering. The same applies to the configurable parameters as ConnMan only
allows for configuring the SSID and PSK of the Wifi network. For example the
private network address is randomized every time and cannot be explicitly
configured.

Installable RPM packages can be downloaded from the pkg directory. Also
available in Jolla store.
